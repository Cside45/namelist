This is a basic name list with very little functionality created on 7/20/2022

This name list is capable of:
- adding a name
- removing a specific line
- displaying the contents of the .txt folder line by line

there is limited error handling in main() through the usage of if statements

the work.py functions were all written by me with the exception of delete_one() as I could not figure out how to do it and cant figure out why it works,
I do not have a math brain and cant even visualize the process in my head.

I tried to comment as much as possible but it may be too much and unnessescary
